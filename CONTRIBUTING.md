## How to Provide Line Edits to Individual Elements of the Framework

Provide any additional commentary you wish on your proposal and then label your proposal at the bottom under “new branch.”  When complete, click “Propose changes.” This will create what is known as a pull request” in GitHub.

You can also comment on someone else’s proposal (referred to as an “open pull request”) by clicking on “Pull requests.” You’ll see all the other comments there. Open the pull request you would like to view. Then, follow the same steps as above.
